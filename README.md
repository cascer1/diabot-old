First, make sure to have a user bot for Discord, if you don't you can make one [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me).

The bot also needs a MySQL database to connect to. It uses environment variables to get login details:

* `DIABOT_DB_HOST`: Database host
* `DIABOT_DB_USER` : Database username
* `DIABOT_DB_PASS`: Database password
* `DIABOT_DB_NAME`: Database name
* `DIABOT_DB_LIMIT`: Database connection limit
